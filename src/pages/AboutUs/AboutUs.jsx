                ByMatching was founded with the vision of simplifying
                collaboration between business and higher education providers.
                <br />
                We think it should be easy to establish contact with students if
                you want to collaborate as a company, but also to take part in
                the latest in research, gain new perspectives that can be put to
                practical use and meet future talents early in their studies. It
                should also be easy for students to get in touch with companies.
                Regardless of industry, size of company or geographical
                location.
                <br />
                <br />
                Our platform digitizes and streamlines the contact between
                student and company or organization. With Bymatching, users can
                resource-efficiently find the right match at the right time.

                innovation, sales, research
              </span> and <span className="font-bold">development</span>. We
              have developed a solution that makes it easy for companies and
              organizations to find collaboration with students of higher
              education. We also want students to have a larger selection of
              companies to collaborate with.
              <br />
              <br />
              We are fully aware of the difficulties that both society and
              academics face. We are also conscious of the advantages that
              collaboration may bring to both parties.
              <br />
              We want to make it easier for students to collaborate with
              companies - to work together, develop, share and acquire new
              experiences.
