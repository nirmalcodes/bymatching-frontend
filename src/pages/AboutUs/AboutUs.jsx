            ByMatching gives{" "}
            <span className="font-bold">Students, Companies</span> and{" "}
            <span className="font-bold">Educational Actors</span> a platform to
            gather on and then be matched and start collaborating with each
            other. We make the match within 48 hours.
            <br />
            <br />
            ByMatching was founded with the vision of simplifying collaboration
            between business and higher education providers.
            <br />
            We think it should be easy to establish contact with students if you
            want to collaborate as a company, but also to take part in the
            latest in research, gain new perspectives that can be put to
            practical use and meet future talents early in their studies. It
            should also be easy for students to get in touch with companies.
            Regardless of industry, size of company or geographical location.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our platform digitizes and streamlines the contact between student
            and company or organization. With Bymatching, users can
            resource-efficiently find the right match at the right time.

              <span className="font-bold">innovation, sales, research</span> and{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">development</span>. We have developed
              a solution that makes it easy for companies and organizations to
              find collaboration with students of higher education. We also want
              students to have a larger selection of companies to collaborate
              with.
              <br />
              <br />
              We are fully aware of the difficulties that both society and
              academics face. We are also conscious of the advantages that
              collaboration may bring to both parties.
              <br />
              We want to make it easier for students to collaborate with
              companies - to work together, develop, share and acquire new
              experiences.
